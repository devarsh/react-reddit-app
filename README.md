#react-reddit-app

A Simple react Reddit Application which fetches the topics from reddit API and displays the list of topics,titles &author name, 
along with the content 

Initial app rendering takes place on the server and the subsequent rendering on the client.

It uses the following technologies
1.) Webpack as the module bundler for both client & Server.
2.) React server rendering and Client rendering.
3.) Redux to manage the state of the application (async redux action creators are used as well)

Ps: This is an extension of react-redux Reddit example application.
